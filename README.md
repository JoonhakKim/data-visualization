Personal Project

Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and SQLite to visualize and analyze stock price data.
########
So far...

The program retrieves stock data from .yfinance API and stores it in a local SQLite database.

By default, it loads data from the local database unless specifically told to update via .yfinance API.

Retrieved data is automatically processed to compute seful metrics and variables such as volume-adjusted prices, percentage price changes, and more.

#Near-term goals include:

##Data Visualization Enhancements:

  1: 3D charts: bar charts, surface plots, and wireframes.

  2: Functions for sorting data by date intervals.

  3: 2D visualizations: bar charts and line charts with volume displayed beneath.

##Probability & Statistics Integration:

  1:Z-scores calculated from user-defined sample means. 

  2:A simple predictive model using linear regression.

  3:Visualizations of sample distributions.

  
Looking Ahead

  Identifying more variables (industry type, per,... etc) in relation to stock prices 

  Integrating the OpenAI API to refine distributions and improve sample mean selection.

  Building a lightweight backend and frontend to display data on a customizable webpage.
